Day 1: Data Types!

For this challenge, consider the following inputs (you don't need to read any input):

5.35
'a'
false
100
"I am a code monkey"
true
17.3
'c'
"derp"

For each line above, print out if it is an instance of a primitive or referenced type as well as which data type it is (using the typical examples above).

Note: This challenge is focused only on Java data types, but you can submit the answer in other languages as well. Hint: In Java, String is a referenced type. Most challenges in upcoming days are language-agnostic.

Good luck!

Output Format

Output nine lines. Print one line for each of the input given above in the following format:

MainDataTypeOfInstance : SpecificDataTypeOfInstance
For example, if the input is:

123
Your output should be:

Primitive : int
Make sure you spell everything correctly and capitalize your entries. Also, don't forget spaces and colon in between the main and specific data types!
